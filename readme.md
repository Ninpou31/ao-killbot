### Usage
* !ping - replies with @user pong
* !kbclear - delets all messages in the config.botChannel
* !kbinfo $eventId - displays the killboard post for a specific kill to the current channel
* !kills $playerName [$n] - displays the last n kills of the given player. If n is not given, then it is set to 1
### Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

### Config
* **To add the bot to your server**: 
Visit https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}&scope=bot&permissions=0
Example: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=975390562344173493&scope=bot&permissions=0

###### * to only display Guild kills and not alliance, set allianceName to something that cannot exist i.e <NONE>

Example: config.json
--
```json
{
	"cmdPrefix": "!",
	"allianceName": "<NONE>",
	"guildName": "8-bit",
	"username": "AO-Killbot",
	"admins": [
		"224865398034079430"
	],
	"botChannel": "445822300890946337",
	"playingGame": "Albion Killboard Bot",
	"token": "zMznafHXfbgaD3k0.hYN.CDTzsMHXz_35MNMiGyLOT-8EoQotgEs10iZAa7"
}
```

### Manual Install
* Install Node JS on the machine that will run the bot
* Create a new [Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
* Copy config.json.example --> config.json
* Add the 'APP BOT USER' token as 'token' in 'config.json'
* Enable developer mode in Discord (Settings -> Appearance)
* Right click the channel you wish to use as the kill board, and Copy ID
* Set ID as 'botChannel'
* OPTIONAL: Set User IDs for admin accounts

### Run with Docker
* You need Docker installed on your machine. Visit https://www.docker.com/ for more information.
* Create new directory in this project directory (called for example like the guild you'd like to create the bot)
* Place the filled out config.json file inside that directory. So for the "templer" guild, you'd have ./templer/config.json
* Call the script as "./create_service templer"
* Enjoy

### Built With

* [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) - Discordapp library for Node.js and browsers.
